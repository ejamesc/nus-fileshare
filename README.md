### NUS Fileshare ###

Written in Flask - this is a prototype for a 'Rapidshare@NUS', as proposed to NUS Hackers by Ong Guan Sin from NUS ComCen.

Note: this is incomplete, and will likely be a very basic implementation. Will need to figure out how to control or limit the types of files uploaded and shared on campus.
